# Particle Swarm Optimization Algortihm (PSO)

This is a custom algorithm based on the concepts of the basic particle optimization 
algorithm. The aim of this script is to utilize a PSO algortihm in order to find the 
optimal set of phase space kinematic variables for which the signal significance is 
maximized. 

The optimal set is to be used by the CRO algorithms in order to find the signal for 
the maximum possible significance and ultimately measure the cross section.
