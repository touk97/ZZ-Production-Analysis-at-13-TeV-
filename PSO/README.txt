This Script uses the basic concepts of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms 
in order to find the optimal set of values of the kinematic variables that define 
the phase space for the ATLAS Detector for the process pp -> ZZ -> llvv. The optimal 
phase space is the one for which the maximum signal significance is obtained according 
to the formula:
                Z = sqrt(2 * ((S + B) * log(1 + (S / B)) - S));
where S is the signal S = S_QCD + S_EWK = llvv + llvvjj and B is the total background.
